# google-homepage
The point of this project was to build the Google homepage, the simple one with just the search box and essentially without any functionality. In doing this project, given to me by The Odin Project, I have become more familiar with HTML and CSS. It has  allowed me to become more familiar with DevTools and all the wonderful perks it has. A little bit about the process in writing this project, first I did all I could without DevTools, as far as the HTML goes, then I began diving deeper by reading other webpages code to better understand the general layout. After I layed down the Google homepage and played with the CSS to format it like the original, I copied the Google search form and wrote it as an action in the HTML.
